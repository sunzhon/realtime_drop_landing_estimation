# realtime_drop_landing_estimation

This project provides a modular LSTM-based model to estimate vGRF and KEM with werable IMUs in real-time during single- and double-leg drop landings 

## Getting started

To run develop.py to training the model and evaluate the model.

The IMU configurations and LSTM unit number can be setup in develop.py
